# Personal Website Creation

I am currently completing my studies in Aerospace Engineering, a field quite different from web development or computer science. Despite this, I enjoy exploring new areas and expanding my knowledge. The main goal of this website is to share the various projects I work on from now on.

The first project showcased here is the website itself. While I initially wanted to build it from scratch, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript felt like a significant hurdle to dive into the vast world of web development. Instead, I chose [Reflex](https://reflex.dev/), a Python library that simplifies the process of creating websites.

The website has two main purposes:

- To provide an easy way to upload and showcase my projects. I aim to minimize the time spent on article creation so I can focus more on the projects themselves.
- To introduce myself, my interests, and my work to anyone who might be interested.

As this is my first foray into web development, I have kept the design simple and clean. The website features:

- A landing page with an introduction, project cards, and a contact section displaying my links and contact information.
- Each project card links to a dedicated page created directly from a Markdown file, significantly streamlining the process of writing and publishing articles.
