## Implementation in Swan Framework
The [Swan framework](https://github.com/SwanLab/Swan), developed by CIMNE, serves as a collaborative, open-source FEM tool for solving various structural, fluid, and optimization problems. The implementation process followed these steps:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: All new elements were integrated into Swan's existing OOP architecture to ensure compatibility and scalability.
- **Clean Code Practices**: Emphasis was placed on creating readable, maintainable, and reusable code for future expansions.
- **Validation**: Each implementation was rigorously tested against benchmark cases to ensure accuracy.

## Conclusion and Future Work
This thesis establishes a solid foundation for solving multi-physics problems using the finite element method within the Swan framework. While the current implementation focuses on specific elements and problems, it provides a roadmap for extending Swan's capabilities. Potential future directions include:
- Expanding the library of finite elements to address additional multi-physics scenarios.
- Improving computational efficiency through advanced algorithms and parallel computing techniques.
- Applying the framework to real-world problems in aerospace, energy, and biomedical engineering.
