Over the studied three-day period, the majority of Earth’s surface is covered by 1–2 satellites simultaneously:

- No coverage: 1.04%
- 1 satellite coverage: 51.14%
- 2 satellite coverage: 45.48%
- 3 satellite coverage: 2.35%

The analysis highlights efficient coverage with negligible downtime, validating Draim’s design.


## Coordinate Transformation to Celestial Reference Frame (CRF)  
Satellite coordinates are transformed to the Celestial Reference Frame using the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time. This transformation allows visualization of the orbits in a stable inertial frame, providing an independent view unaffected by Earth’s rotation or precession.
