# John Draim's Constellation

In the 1980s, John Draim proposed a ground-breaking satellite constellation design using just four satellites to achieve full global coverage. This design, based on a perturbed tetrahedral configuration, offers substantial economic advantages and a wide range of applications, including communications, Earth observation, and meteorology.

This project focuses on analysing Draim's constellation over a two-day period. Key tasks include calculating orbital parameters, converting coordinate systems, and visualizing the results.


## Input Data

The constellation is modeled as a modified tetrahedron with the following orbital parameters:
