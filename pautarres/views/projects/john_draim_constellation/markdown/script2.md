The satellite position and velocity data at 600-second intervals of the first three days of 2001 has been considered in order to develop this study.

## Geocentric Satellite coordinates
Satellite coordinates in the Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) system can be transformed to spherical geocentric coordinates (r, λ, ϕ) using MATLAB’s `cart2sph` function. The geocentric distance has been plotted as a function of time, revealing periodic sinusoidal behaviour.
