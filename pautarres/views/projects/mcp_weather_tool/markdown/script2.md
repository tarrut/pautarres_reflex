## Current Weather Tool

The **Current Weather Tool** is a simple MCP server that interfaces with the Weather API to provide up-to-date weather information. When connected to an MCP-compatible host like Claude Desktop, users can query the tool using natural language prompts (e.g., "What's the weather in London?").
